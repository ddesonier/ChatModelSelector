```powershell
.\test-connection.ps1
```
This script will check all your environment variables and test the Azure connection.

### Common Issues

**"Must provide either the api_version argument or the OPENAI_API_VERSION environment variable"**
- Solution: Ensure `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` is set in your `.env` file

**"ResourceNotFound: The Resource 'your-resource' was not found"**
- Solution: Run `.\discover-azure-resources.ps1` to find your correct resource names
- Verify `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` and `AOAI_ACCOUNT_NAME` in your `.env` file
- Check that you're logged into the correct Azure subscription

**"No deployments found"**
- Ensure your Azure OpenAI resource has model deployments created
- Check permissions: you need at least "Cognitive Services User" role
- Verify your subscription ID is correct

### General Tips
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Check that your Azure credentials have proper permissions
- Verify that your Azure OpenAI resource has deployments configured
- Use the discovery script to automatically find your resource details
